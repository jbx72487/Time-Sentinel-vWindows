Why Time Sentinel?

       Time Sentinel is the anti-procrastination tool designed to protect you (and your time) from 
yourself. The program blocks certain internet-related applications on the user's computer, at the 
user's request, for a specified period of time.

Configuring Time Sentinel

	There are four main configuration categories in the Time Sentinel settings, which is the 
window that immediately opens upon executing the program: Restriction Level, Time Limit, Unblock 
Event, and Hacker Options.
	Restriction level is the extent to which the user wishes to restrict his/her access to 
applications on the computer. The user may select one or multiple options, but he/she must select at 
least one or else an error message will pop up. The radio button next to the "Certain internet-based 
applications" label is a testament to the fact that this program was originally intended to block 
wireless access as well, but that proved to be too difficult. It is highly likely that the option will be 
implemented in the near future, so there are a few pieces of code that are commented out for that 
particular purpose.
	Time Limit is the length of time that the user wishes to impose the restrictions on the 
computer. He/she can either specify a period of time (with an imposed maximum of 6 hours 59 
minutes) or choose to lift the restrictions only when an "unblock event" occurs.
	The Unblock Event is the test that the user must pass before the restrictions are lifted. If the 
user chooses a specified time period for the restrictions, this option allows the user to choose 
whether he/she can lift restrictions before time expires and how to do so. If the user opts to lift 
restrictions at an unblock event, then the user must choose one of the unblock events, not "Never," 
so that the restrictions will have some finite end. The unblock event options, apart from "Never," are 
1) clicking through a series of confirmation dialogue boxes, 2) solving five two-digit multiplication 
problems, and 3) entering a password. If the user chooses the password option, he/she (or even 
better, a roommate or neighbor) must enter and reenter the password to set it on the spot.
	Lastly, the Hacker Options may be accessed by clicking on a button in the section, with a 
warning label both in the section and in the dialog box that comes up. The only hacker option is 
currently to block task manager in addition to blocking all of the selected programs. In the near future, 
it is likely that the ability for the program to continue running at startup, so that the user cannot turn 
off the restrictions using a reboot, will be implemented.
	Select your settings as desired, and click Okay to begin protecting you from yourself. Or, 
press Cancel to quit the program, if you changed your mind. Upon pressing Okay, you may receive 
some error messages indicating invalid input. Not selecting any programs to block, attempting to 
disable access for 0 hours and 0 minutes, and not entering in matching passwords will all raise an error. 
Blank passwords are valid.
	


What You See Now

	At this point, you will see a dialog box entitled "Restrictions in Effect," with either a 
countdown of hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until restrictions are lifted, or a simple 
"Restrictions in Effect" dialog box. You'll notice that the X button in the corner, to close the window, 
is disabled. This is so that the window may stay as a reminder, for as long as your restrictions are in 
effect, for you to get to work! 
       In addition, you may or may not have noticed the brand spankin' new icon in your system 
tray, although it is mentioned in the dialog box. You may right click on this icon to either learn more 
about the program through "About Time Sentinel," or, if the user specified an unblock event (rather 
than "never" manually unblock, in which case this option is disabled), attempt to lift the restrictions 
with the "Lift Restrictions" option. The former brings up a simple dialog box about the program. The 
latter brings up the appropriate test for the user's chosen unblock event in a new dialog box. If the 
user passes this test, the program will notify the user that the restrictions are lifted. If the user 
changes his/her mind about lifting the restrictions at any time during the unblock process, he/she can 
always "Cancel" out of the process.
       If the user does not lift restrictions manually, when the designated time runs out, or when 
the internally-set maximum allowed time (currently 12 hours) expires, the program will also notify 
the user of such and then terminate.



Have Fun!

       Have fun with my program! This was such an amazing learning experience for me, and I've certainly 
enjoyed making it. Thanks.
